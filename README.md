# Introduction

**Luminosity** is based on Windows's native Acrylic, using the maximum `TintLuminosityOpacity` value as its backdrop and more rounded UI elements.

It's meant to work well on dark windows, with **Mica** or **MicaAlt** backdrops, with or without the **Translucent Windows** mod.

# Planned

### Taskbar
- Virtual Desktops Right-Click menus, but I have no clue on how to find their targets.

### Start Menu
- Is passing through a complete rewrite.

### Notification / Action Center
- Attempt to add missing JumpLists menu animations, and maybe remove more separation borders in other areas of the Action Center (Wired Display & Project).

### File Explorer
- Attempt to remove drop shadows and add matching corner radius and borders to more XAML elements.
	- I believe I can't add the Luminosity backdrop.
